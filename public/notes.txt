Introduction 

 
Welcome to our small family-run business!
Here's a little bit about us and how CraftsAndBusyGifts started. 
Weâ€™re a husband-and-wife (Ciara and Peter) duo who started this venture 4 years ago. 

It all began when I decided to create a busy board as a first birthday gift for my friendâ€™s little girl. Iâ€™ve always loved making unique and meaningful presents for friends and family, but this was a completely new challenge. I had no clue where to start with making a busy board, but I went ahead anyway.
Peter, confidently claimed he could do a better job â€“ and as much as I hate to admit it... he absolutely did! This sparked an idea, and Peter suggested that others might also be interested in our boards. Thatâ€™s how CraftsAndBusyGifts came to life in 2020!
With my creativity and design skills paired with Peterâ€™s craftsmanship, we make a fantastic team. Alongside our day jobs, weâ€™ve worked hard to develop a range of busy boards. Even our three children have embraced this exciting journey and lend a hand now and then. Yes, the juggle is very real! but so is our passion for what we do.

The support weâ€™ve received so far has been incredible, and weâ€™re endlessly grateful for the encouragement and kindness. Weâ€™re so proud of our family business and love every moment of it. ðŸ’š

That bring us to now. Based in our back garden in Essex, we specialise in creating handmade, personalised gifts, crafted with love and care to make every occasion extra special. bringing touch of thoughtfulness to every occasion.


Weâ€™re incredibly proud to have reached over 10,000 sales on Etsy, a milestone that reminds us how much our customers support us. Your support means the world to us and helps keep our dream alive. 

Thank you for stopping byâ€”we hope you enjoy browsing our website and we canâ€™t wait to create something special for you!
